# 💰 Expense Tracker App

A simple and powerful **React-based Expense Tracker** that helps users manage income, expenses, and overall balance.  
This project was built as a hands-on learning exercise to practice React fundamentals while delivering a real-world application.

## Overview

This is an expense tracker application that I'm building to learn and practice React development. Through this project, I'll be gaining hands-on experience with React fundamentals including components, state management, and building interactive user interfaces.

## Project Purpose

- Learn how to use React to build dynamic web applications
- Understand component architecture and lifecycle
- Practice state management and data flow in React
- Build a functional expense tracking application

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Expense & Income Management

- Add new transactions (income or expense).
- Track balances dynamically as entries are added.
- View a list of recent transactions for quick review.

### 2. Transaction Controls

- Edit transactions to correct mistakes.
- Delete transactions when no longer needed.
- Reset functionality to clear all data and start fresh.

### 3. Data Handling & Storage

- Local Storage integration for data persistence across browser refreshes.
- Form validation ensures proper user input before saving.
- Efficient rendering of transaction lists using array methods.

### 4. Navigation & Routing

- Multi-page navigation with **React Router**.
- Navbar with active link highlighting.
- 404 error page for invalid routes.
- Report page to view summarized financial data.

### 5. User Interface & Visualization

- Dashboard showing income, expenses, and balance.
- Interactive charts using **React Charts** for financial trends.
- Modern UI with **React Icons** for a polished look.

### 6. API Integration

- Fetch external data (e.g., motivational quotes modal).
- Demonstrates handling asynchronous API calls in React.

### 7. Deployment & Testing

- Deployed on **Vercel** for live hosting.
- Includes app testing walkthrough to ensure functionality before release.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (with hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`)
- **React Router** for navigation
- **React Charts** for visualization
- **React Icons** for UI enhancements
- **Local Storage** for persistence
- **Vercel** for deployment

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

By building this project, you’ll practice:

- React basics: JSX, components, props, state, hooks.
- React lifecycle & virtual DOM concepts.
- Data flow management between components.
- Real-world project structuring and deployment.

---

## ⚡ Why This Project Stands Out

- Hands-on and practical: you end up with a working app, not just theory.
- Covers end-to-end development: setup → features → deployment.
- Teaches best practices like validation, persistence, and modular UI design.
